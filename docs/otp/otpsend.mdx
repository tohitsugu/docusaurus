## Sending a One-Time Passcode 

### Via SMS


As part of your sign-in process, users will receive an SMS message to their phone number with a one-time passcode. Users will need to verify that one-time passcode on your application or website in order to authenticate their sign-in. 


Numbers from US and Canada are currently supported.



### Via Email

#  Verifying BlockID One-Time Passcodes

## Verifying a One-Time Passcode


As part of your sign-in process, users will receive an email containing a one-time passcode. Users will need to enter that one-time passcode on your application or website in order to authenticate their sign-in. 

:::danger
If an incorrect code is sent more than three times within a 15 (?) minute window, the BlockID User account will be temporarily blocked by our servers. When an account is blocked, users will be unable to send or verify one-time passcodes. Accounts will automatically be unlocked after sixty minutes (?)

## Unlocking a Locked Account

BlockID Community Administrators can force unlock a one-time passcode for a user by sending an `unlock` request to the **[BlockID Developer API](https://blockid-trial.1kosmos.net/swagger-ui.html)**.
